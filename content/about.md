Hi — I’m **Anirudh**, a systems thinker, builder, and engineering leader.

I design and deliver **scalable, cloud-native solutions** that move organizations forward — with clarity, purpose, and precision. Over the past 6+ years, I’ve worked across **clean tech, renewable energy, and global finance**, partnering with organizations like **RWE Clean Energy**, **JP Morgan Chase**, and **ICICI Bank** to turn complexity into working systems.

I work hands-on at the intersection of **software engineering**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **data-driven automation** — and I lead from that place. I build not just applications, but clarity and capability inside teams.

---

### What I Do Best

I specialize in delivering:

- **Modular, production-grade backend systems** in Python and Java  
- **End-to-end cloud architecture** on Azure and GCP  
- **Automation pipelines** with Docker, CI/CD tools, and DevOps practices  
- **Data infrastructure and visualization**, from ETL to dashboards  
- **ML-enabling systems**, supporting fast experimentation and real-world deployment

My toolkit includes technologies like **FastAPI**, **Apache Beam**, **SQL**, **Kubernetes**, and more — always chosen with purpose and scaled with care.

### What I’m Exploring

I’m actively aligned with opportunities where I can:

- Contribute as a **senior engineer or architect** on high-impact systems  
- Evolve toward **machine learning infrastructure** and **applied data science**  
- Join a team that values **clarity, purpose, and well-built software**

I don’t chase trends — I build with purpose.

---

### How I Operate

What drives me isn’t just code — it’s clarity. I approach systems and teams the same way:

- Understand deeply  
- Design thoughtfully  
- Build intentionally  
- Expand continuously

I’m fueled by curiosity, guided by discipline, and anchored in a vision that blends **technical mastery with human impact**.

### Outside the Console

I stay grounded through community, movement, and exploration.

- Member of **The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi** and the **Analytics & Big Data Society**  
- Enjoy playing soccer, badminton, and spikeball  
- Constant learner, occasional traveler, and deep connector

### Let’s Talk

If you're building something meaningful in **software, cloud, or data**, I’d love to connect.

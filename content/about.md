👋 Hi, I'm **Anirudh** — a software and data professional who enjoys solving real-world problems through clean code, thoughtful design, and continuous learning.

Over the last **6+ years**, I've worked across **Banking**, **Finance**, **Renewable Energy**, and **Clean Tech**, contributing to teams at **JP Morgan Chase**, **ICICI Bank**, **National Commercial Bank**, and **RWE Clean Energy Services, LLC**. I’ve built and maintained production-grade systems that power business-critical tools and data workflows.

Currently, I work as a **Software Engineering Manager**, focused on building and maintaining **Machine Learning infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. While the title includes “manager,” my day-to-day involves a strong **individual contributor focus** — designing, coding, deploying, and improving technical systems.

### 🔧 What I Offer

I bring practical, hands-on experience in:

- **Software Development** – Writing clean, modular code for backend systems and tools
- **Data Engineering** – Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analytics and ML pipelines
- **Dashboarding & Visualization** – Creating actionable dashboards to support business decisions
- **Cloud Engineering** – Building and deploying systems on GCP with CI/CD pipelines
- **Automation & CI/CD** – Streamlining workflows using modern DevOps practices

My technical foundation includes skills in **Python**, **SQL**, **GCP**, **Docker**, and tools like **Looker** and **Data Studio**. I’ve also been actively expanding into **Data Science and Machine Learning**, working on internal projects and self-driven learning to strengthen that transition.

### 🎯 Career Focus

I'm currently exploring roles where I can:

- **Leverage my software and data experience**
- **Continue working on real-world problems with clean code and scalable solutions**
- **Grow deeper into Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI engineering**

I'm especially excited about opportunities that blend **software craftsmanship**, **data understanding**, and **ML potential**, where I can contribute right away while continuing to learn and evolve.

### 🌱 Community & Interests

I'm a member of the **Analytics and Big Data Society** (Charlotte, NC) and **The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi**, staying active in communities focused on technology and learning.

Outside of work, I enjoy:
- ⚽ Playing soccer, badminton, and spikeball
- 🌍 Traveling and exploring new places
- 🤝 Meeting people and sharing ideas

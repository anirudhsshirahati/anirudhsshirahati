👋 Hi, I'm **Anirudh** — a software and data professional who enjoys solving real-world problems through clean code, thoughtful system design, and continuous learning.

Over the past **6+ years**, I’ve contributed to impactful technology projects across **Renewable Energy**, **Clean Tech**, **Banking**, and **Finance**, supporting leading organizations like **RWE Clean Energy Services**, **JP Morgan Chase**, **ICICI Bank**, and **National Commercial Bank**.

I currently work as a **Software Engineering Manager** at **RWE Clean Energy Services**, where I focus on building scalable, cloud-native applications and automating data-driven processes. While my title includes “manager,” my role remains **deeply technical and hands-on** — leading design, development, and deployment efforts across software and infrastructure layers.

## 1. **Housing Price Prediction Service**
- **Description**: This project involved building and deploying a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on a set of features like location, square footage, and number of rooms.
- **Problem**: The real estate market can be difficult to navigate without data-driven insights into property values.
- **Solution**: I used regression models to predict prices and deployed the model as a service using **Python** and **Google Cloud Run**.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Google Cloud Run, ML Models, CI/CD, Docker
- **Results**: The deployed service enables real-time predictions for housing prices, streamlining decision-making for real estate professionals.

## 2. **Serverless ETL Data Pipeline**
- **Description**: A serverless data pipeline to process and transform large datasets for downstream analytics. The pipeline handles data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using **Google Cloud Dataflow**.
- **Problem**: Traditional ETL pipelines were slow and resource-heavy, requiring substantial maintenance.
- **Solution**: I designed a scalable serverless ETL pipeline that efficiently processes large datasets in the cloud.
- **Technologies Used**: Google Cloud Dataflow, Apache Beam, Python, Cloud Storage
- **Results**: The pipeline can scale automatically to handle varying data loads, making it easier for businesses to process and analyze data in real-time.

## 3. **Bias Evaluation Analysis for ML Models**
- **Description**: In this project, I analyzed structured datasets to evaluate the fairness and bias in machine learning model predictions.
- **Problem**: AI systems are prone to biases that can lead to unfair or discriminatory decisions.
- **Solution**: I implemented an analysis framework to measure bias in model predictions and provided actionable insights to mitigate biases.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Bias Mitigation Libraries
- **Results**: The framework helps improve fairness in model predictions, ensuring that AI systems are ethical and equitable.

## ML Bias Evaluation Tool (Research)  
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit  
Private research repo  

Developed an interactive tool to detect and visualize algorithmic bias in ML datasets, used as part of academic research on fairness and accountability.

- Measured bias using metrics like disparate impact and equal opportunity.  
- Visualized model fairness tradeoffs to inform ethical model design.  
- Automated bias detection workflows for consistent reproducibility.

> **Why it matters:** Addresses responsible AI development — increasingly essential for hiring in regulated or ethical tech domains.

## Bias-Driven ML SaaS Platform  
**Tech:** Python, Docker, GCP (Cloud SQL, Firestore, AI Platform, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run)  
[University project](https://www.uncertaintyquantification.org/home)   

Built a no-code SaaS platform that allows users to run containerized ML experiments and evaluate bias and performance in real time.

- Automated ML model training and evaluation in 3 clicks.  
- Leveraged GCP Cloud Functions for orchestration and Firestore for state management.  
- Enabled reproducible experiments across protected features.

> **Why it matters:** Combines SaaS development, ML automation, and GCP experience — highly aligned with backend/data/cloud roles in 2025.

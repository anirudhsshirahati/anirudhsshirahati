As a research assistant in the UQ Lab, he designed and deployed an end-to-end infrastructure on Google Cloud for training and serving neural causal models such as NOTEARS, enriched with constraints elicited from domain experts via a custom front-end web interface. Anirudh is a detail-oriented engineer, an excellent collaborator, and consistently eager to take on complex challenges.
